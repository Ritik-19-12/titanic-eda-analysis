# Titanic EDA â€“ Summary Report ðŸ“Š

## 1. Objective

Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns, distributions, and relationships that impact survival.

---

## 2. Key Findings

### âœ… Data Distribution

- **Age**: Most passengers were between 20â€“40 years old.
- **Fare**: Highly skewed; a few very high fares.
- **Pclass**: Majority in 3rd class.

### âœ… Missing Values

- **Age** had 177 missing values.
- **Cabin** was missing for over 75% of rows â€” dropped from analysis.
- **Embarked** had 2 missing rows â€” filled with most frequent value (`S`).

### âœ… Outliers

- **Fare** had outliers above 300, verified by IQR and Z-score.
- **Age** had a few outliers over 70â€“80.

### âœ… Relationships

- **Gender**: Female survival rate much higher than male.
- **Pclass**: Higher class â†’ higher survival.
- **Fare & Age** had weak positive correlation with survival.
- **Heatmap** showed minor correlation between Fare, Pclass, and Survival.

## 3. Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 4. Conclusion

The analysis uncovered strong patterns that could be useful for predictive modeling â€” notably, the impact of gender, class, and fare on survival.
